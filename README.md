# learning-HTML
Welcome to my first HTML and CSS project as a beginner!
This repository contains my first codes created and modified about websites and some applications.
It describes the journey taken during my learning HTML and CSS using Sololearn.com.
As a beginner, I am still learning the basics of HTML and CSS, so please be patient with any mistakes or errors you may come across.
I am excited to share my progress and journey with you as I continue to improve my skills and build more complex projects.
Feel free to explore my code and provide any feedback or suggestions.
Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository!
